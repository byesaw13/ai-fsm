- Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-16T20:00:00Z
- Agent: agent-orchestrator (Claude Code)
- Branch: orchestrator/start-process-wave1
- Task ID: P0-T1, P0-T2, P0-T3 (#7, #8, #9)
- Summary: Froze all three P0 contracts with full source evidence from dovelite and myprogram. Updated domain Zod schemas to cover all entities (account, user, client, property, job, visit, estimate, invoice, payment, automation, audit_log) with status transition maps. Updated core migration to match frozen contract (added properties, estimate_line_items, invoice_line_items, audit_log tables; added updated_at triggers, created_by FKs, and comprehensive indexes). Updated seed data with deterministic UUIDs and two test accounts for RLS abuse testing.
- Files changed:
  - docs/contracts/domain-model.md (frozen — full entity specs, relationships, immutability rules)
  - docs/contracts/workflow-states.md (frozen — transition tables, role matrix, automation types)
  - docs/contracts/api-contract.md (frozen — all endpoints, error model, pagination, auth)
  - docs/contracts/test-strategy.md (frozen — tooling, categories, RLS abuse tests, phase rollout)
  - packages/domain/src/index.ts (full Zod schemas for all entities + transition maps + API error model)
  - db/migrations/001_core_schema.sql (complete schema matching frozen contract)
  - db/migrations/002_seed_dev.sql (two accounts, four users with deterministic UUIDs)
  - docs/WORK_ASSIGNMENT.md (P0 claims resolved)
  - CLAUDE.md (created for Claude Code onboarding)
- Commands run:
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm gate (lint ✅ typecheck ✅ build ✅ test ✅)
- Gate results: lint ✅ | typecheck ✅ | build ✅ | test ✅ (placeholder)
- Source evidence:
  - Dovelite: db/001_initial_schema.sql (visit schema), db/002_rls_policies.sql (RLS pattern), tests/fixtures.ts (deterministic UUIDs), playwright.config.ts (E2E config)
  - Myprogram: DOMAIN_MODEL.md (entity structure), RLS_POLICY_MATRIX.md (RBAC matrix), supabase/migrations/001-003 (schema, RLS, workflow invariants), EDGE_FUNCTIONS.md (API patterns)
- Risks or follow-ups:
  - Tests are still placeholders — real test infrastructure needed in P1.
  - Migration not yet applied to a real database — validate in P1-T2.
  - P0 complete — P1 tasks (auth, schema+RLS, audit, CI/CD) are now unblocked.

- Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-17T00:00:00Z
- Agent: agent-b (DB+RLS Specialist)
- Branch: agent-b/P1-T2-rls-migrations
- Task ID: P1-T2
- Summary: Implemented full RLS policy suite (003_rls_policies.sql) and workflow invariant triggers (004_workflow_invariants.sql). RLS uses PostgreSQL session variables (app.current_user_id, app.current_account_id, app.current_role) set by the app layer. All 13 tables have RLS enabled with force_rls. Role matrix enforced at DB layer: owner/admin write access, tech read-only on estimates/invoices, tech update own-assigned visits only. Workflow guards enforce valid state transitions for jobs/visits/estimates/invoices; immutability triggers block field edits in non-editable states; payment INSERT trigger auto-syncs invoice paid_cents and status.
- Files changed:
  - db/migrations/003_rls_policies.sql (RLS helper functions, enable+force RLS, all policies)
  - db/migrations/004_workflow_invariants.sql (job/visit/estimate/invoice transition guards, immutability triggers, payment→invoice sync trigger)
  - docs/WORK_ASSIGNMENT.md (P1-T2 claim)
- Commands run:
  - rm -rf apps/web/.next && pnpm gate
- Gate results: lint ✅ | typecheck ✅ | build ✅ | test ✅
- Source evidence:
  - Myprogram: supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql (RBAC policy structure, account-scoped helper functions, security definer pattern), supabase/migrations/003_workflow_invariants.sql (transition validation functions, immutability trigger pattern)
  - Dovelite: db/002_rls_policies.sql (account-scoped RLS helper pattern, enable_rls + force_rls), db/001_initial_schema.sql (arrived_at/completed_at auto-set pattern)
- Risks or follow-ups:
  - sync_invoice_on_payment uses security definer — must validate RLS pass-through in integration tests (P1-T3/P3).
  - Migrations not yet applied to live DB — validate against real PostgreSQL in next infra task.
  - P1-T2 complete pending merge after P1-T1 lands on main first (per orchestrator directive).
  - P1-T3 (audit log) remains blocked until P1-T1 + P1-T2 are both merged.

- Agent: agent-c (Frontend+QA Specialist)
- Branch: agent-c/P2-T3-role-based-admin-tech-views
- Task ID: P2-T3 / Issue #16
- Summary: Implemented role-based admin and tech UI views for jobs and visits. Admin sees all jobs/visits with status transition controls and visit scheduling; tech sees only assigned jobs/visits with notes form and allowed status transitions. Role-aware nav hides finance/automations links from tech. All forbidden actions hidden client-side; API enforces hard RBAC. Added 7 new permission helpers. Added 32 new Vitest unit tests (all passing). Added Playwright E2E smoke specs for admin and tech roles.
- Files changed:
  - apps/web/lib/auth/permissions.ts (added: canCreateVisit, canAssignVisit, canTransitionJob, canTransitionVisit, canUpdateVisitNotes, canViewAllJobs, canViewAllVisits)
  - apps/web/app/app/layout.tsx (role-aware nav: hides estimates/invoices/automations from tech; role badge)
  - apps/web/app/app/jobs/page.tsx (jobs list: admin sees all, tech sees assigned-only via JOIN on visits)
  - apps/web/app/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx (job detail: transition panel admin-only, visit list role-scoped)
  - apps/web/app/app/jobs/[id]/JobTransitionForm.tsx (client component: job status transition via API)
  - apps/web/app/app/jobs/new/page.tsx (stub: role-guarded, links to P2-T1 form)
  - apps/web/app/app/jobs/[id]/visits/new/page.tsx (stub: role-guarded, links to P2-T2 form)
  - apps/web/app/app/visits/page.tsx (visits list: admin sees all+unassigned badge, tech assigned-only)
  - apps/web/app/app/visits/[id]/page.tsx (visit detail: transition panel all roles, notes form all roles, assignment info)
  - apps/web/app/app/visits/[id]/VisitTransitionForm.tsx (client component: visit status transition via API)
  - apps/web/app/app/visits/[id]/VisitNotesForm.tsx (client component: PATCH tech_notes via API)
  - apps/web/app/globals.css (nav, role badges, status pills, card/button/form styles)
  - apps/web/lib/auth/__tests__/role-views.unit.test.ts (32 unit tests for new permissions)
  - tests/e2e/admin-smoke.spec.ts (Playwright E2E: admin role smoke path)
  - tests/e2e/tech-smoke.spec.ts (Playwright E2E: tech role smoke path)
  - docs/WORK_ASSIGNMENT.md (claim registered)
- Commands run:
  - pnpm lint ✅
  - pnpm typecheck ✅
  - pnpm build ✅
  - pnpm test ✅ (73 unit tests: 4 files, all pass — 32 new in role-views.unit.test.ts)
- Gate results: lint ✅ | typecheck ✅ | build ✅ | test ✅ (73 tests)
- Source evidence:
  - Dovelite: app/admin/visits/page.tsx — grouped-by-status pattern, scheduled/in-progress/completed sections, client name display, unassigned/scheduled badge pattern
  - Dovelite: app/admin/layout.tsx — role-protected layout pattern with redirect
  - Dovelite: components/Button.tsx — btn/btn-primary/btn-secondary class conventions adapted
  - Myprogram: RLS_POLICY_MATRIX.md — tech assignment scope (visits only to assigned_user_id) confirmed as DB-enforced; UI mirrors same constraint
  - Myprogram: DOMAIN_MODEL.md — job/visit status transition maps, role access matrix used for permission helper design
- Adoption decisions:
  - Adopted Dovelite grouped-by-status layout for jobs/visits lists
  - Adopted Dovelite server-side DB query pattern in server components (not loopback HTTP fetch)
  - Client interactive components (transition buttons, notes form) call API routes directly from browser — consistent with Dovelite client-side mutation approach
  - Tech scope enforced via SQL JOIN on visits.assigned_user_id — not client-only — matching Myprogram's RLS approach
- Risks or follow-ups:
  - /app/jobs/new and /app/jobs/[id]/visits/new are stubs pending P2-T1 and P2-T2 merges
  - Playwright E2E specs ready but require running dev server + seeded DB (not run in current CI gate)
  - Assignment update UI (PATCH visits.assigned_user_id) shows info text; full UI needed in follow-on
